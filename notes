TODO:

sections:

skills, about us, realizing your project


--------------SKILLS-------------------------

Available light
dynamic perspectives (i hate this title, just wanna say we're not sitting with our tripod in one place whole event)
Editing
flexible

KEEP TITLES SHORT, OR ELSE DESIGN BREAKS!

if it becomes too many, we just combine similar ones.
too many skills is bad for site design..
