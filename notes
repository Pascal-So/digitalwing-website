global:

font? code bold/light ok? too thin?
Used code light with weight 700 now, which is thick enough.


do we need a blog? probs not



title background picture:
i like how martin is pointing upwards to the dissappearing title when you scroll..
tempted to keep this picture there

subtitile - cinematography?


sections:

skills, about us, realizing your project


--------------SKILLS-------------------------

Available light
Editing
flexible

need pics for those

KEEP TITLES SHORT, OR ELSE DESIGN BREAKS!

ALSO, NOT TOO MANY SKILLS
if it becomes too many, we just combine similar ones.
too many skills is bad for site design..


-------------ABOUT US----------------------
(add pic - together or 2 pics?
rather 2
1 paragraph for each of us? or just a bit of text for both
if we add 1 paragraph for each we could make a nice 2 column design
add links to personal sites)

added 2 columns now. working on responsiveness now that they become rows on narrower displays



add contact email here as well as in realizing project section?


------------REALIZING YOUR PROJECT--------

realize? realise?
title too long? might not work on mobile as well

maybe just: "your project" - is that clear enough?

move above about section?



can we give pricing estimates?
