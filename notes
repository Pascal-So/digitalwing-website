U KNOW WHAT LET'S GET RID OF THAT STUPID SCROLLING THING ALLTOGETHER. IT'S STARTING TO ANNOY ME LIKE HELL.

why are we using git(hub) for communication?


font? code bold/light ok? too thin?
Used code light with weight 700 now, which is thick enough.

ill test on 1440p screen later


TODO:
Better title pic
german version + detection
include jobs on static site

sections:

skills, about us, realizing your project


--------------SKILLS-------------------------

Available light
dynamic perspectives (i hate this title, just wanna say we're not sitting with our tripod in one place whole event)
Editing
flexible


need pics for those

KEEP TITLES SHORT, OR ELSE DESIGN BREAKS!

ALSO, NOT TOO MANY SKILLS
if it becomes too many, we just combine similar ones.
too many skills is bad for site design..

might wanna use 2 columns if we get too many
